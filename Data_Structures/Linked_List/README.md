# Linked List

![Linked List Visual](../../assets/images/linked_list_visual.svg)

## Summary :book:
A linked list organizes items sequentially, with each item storing a pointer to the next one. 
> Picture a linked list like a chain of paperclips linked together. It's quick to add another paperclip to the top or bottom. It's even quick to insert one in the middleâ€”just disconnect the chain at the middle link, add the new paperclip, then reconnect the other half. 
> 
> An item in a linked list is called a node. The first node is called the head. The last node is called the tail.

> Unlike an array, consecutive items in a linked list are not necessarily next to each other in memory. 

## Strengths :white_check_mark:
- Fast operations on the ends
> Adding elements at either end of a linked list is O(1). Removing the first element is also O(1). 
- Flexible Size
> There's no need to specify how many elements you're going to store ahead of time. You can keep adding elements as long as there's enough space on the machine. 

## Weaknesses :x:
- Costly lookups
> To access or edit an item in a linked list, you have to take O(i) time to walk from the head of the list to the ith item. 

## Time Complexity :hourglass:
| Operation  | Worst Case |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| space      |    O(n)    |
| prepend    |    O(1)    |
| append     |    O(1)    |
| lookup     |    O(n)    |
| insert     |    O(n)    |
| delete     |    O(n)    |

## Doubly Linked Lists
> In a basic linked list, each item stores a single pointer to the next element.

In a doubly linked list, items have pointers to the next and the previous nodes. 

![Linked List Visual 3](../../assets/images/linked_list_visual_3.svg)

Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards.
> In a singly linked list, if you just had a pointer to a node in the middle of a list, there would be no way to know what nodes came before it.

Not a problem in a doubly linked list.
