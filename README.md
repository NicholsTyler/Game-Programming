> Several services are already built into Unity ( Random.Range(), Debug.Log(), Mathf.PI() )
- Component
> This is already built into Unity (Colliders, Mesh Renderers, etc.)

## Sequencing Patterns

> This is already built into your computer
- Game Loop
> This is already built into Unity ( Time.deltaTime & Time.fixedDeltaTime )
- Update Method
> This is already built into Unity ( void Update() )
